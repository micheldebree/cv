<h2 id="freelance-full-stack-developer">Freelance Full Stack Developer</h2>
<p><strong>Keywords</strong> Senior, Lead developer, Agile, Java, Javascript, Linux</p>
<p>Full stack software developer with 20+ years of experience in complex and dynamic IT landscapes, who thrives on working on challenging agile projects as part of a multi-disciplinary team.</p>
<p>My technical experience ranges a full development stack. From, for example, provisioning a <em>Linux</em> based server architecture, to developing service-oriented <em>JEE</em>, to implementing a <em>REST API</em> driven <em>Javascript</em> front end.</p>
<p>My experience mainly involves customer facing internet channels that integrate reliably and securely with back office systems, in the field of logistics, telecommunication, banking, medical and public sector. In my daily work I frequently communicate with business analysts as well as the IT department and suppliers of my clients. I often have an advisory role concerning system- and software architecture.</p>
<p>I prefer to work in a motivated, multi-disciplinary, self-directing team with a clear focus on business value, in close collaboration with the various stakeholders. I often find myself in the role of lead developer. I am also constantly looking to improve the quality of solutions and the development process while at the same time delivering real business value.</p>
