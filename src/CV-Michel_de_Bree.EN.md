designing and building the central integration hub for applications in the

is routing, access-control, auditing and self-service for service providers and
service consumers. As such it has high demands on availability, performance,
scalability, security and privacy. Also I work closely with the Standaard
Platform teams for designing new features in the platform that support the use
cases for the Digitaal Stelsel Omgevingswet.

This generic platform is based on the Java platform and open source components.
It is scalable, reliable and secure according to industry standards. A new
instance of the platform, consisting of several virtual Linux servers in a cloud
environment, is provisioned fully automatic from scratch and works out-of-the
box. A central governance solution is included for automatic deployment through
the DTAP cycle and central configuration and management of the business
applications that are hosted on the platform.
