<h2 id="freelance-full-stack-java-developer">Freelance Full Stack Java Developer</h2>
<p>Full stack software developer with 20+ years of experience in complex and dynamic IT landscapes, who thrives on working on challenging agile projects as part of a multi-disciplinary team.</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently working as Lead Developer &amp; Scrum Master (Java, WSO2, Docker, REST, OAuth, Ansible, Linux) React, Agile, Full-stack, Continuous Integration &amp; Delivery</li>
<li>Experienced in Java, JEE, Spring, REST, Javascript, Open Source, Linux, TDD, CI/CD, Agile (Scrum, DevOps)</li>
<li>Continously improving the delivery pipeline</li>
<li>Open to new development challenges involving Java, Spring Boot, Docker, API's, Microservices, CI/CD</li>
</ul>
<p>My technical experience ranges a full development stack. From, for example, provisioning a Linux based server architecture, to developing service-oriented JEE, to implementing a REST API driven Javascript front end. As a developer I am at my best developing backend services and integrating them with other components, while also being involved in the whole development stack.</p>
<p>Solutions I worked on are mainly customer facing internet channels that integrate reliably and securely with back office systems, in the field of logistics, telecommunication, banking, medical and public sector. In my daily work I frequently communicate with business analysts as well as the IT department and suppliers of my clients. I often have an advisory role concerning system- and software architecture.</p>
<p>I prefer to work in a motivated, multi-disciplinary, self-directing team with a clear focus on business value, in close collaboration with the various stakeholders. I often find myself in the role of lead developer. I am also constantly looking to improve the quality of solutions and the development process while at the same time delivering real business value.</p>
<p>My broad experience and creative nature allows me to quickly assess different options and make balanced decisions based on best practices, future-proofness, fit/gap for the specific situation and the expected return on investment.</p>

<p>While working for the Standaard Platform Alliance, I am now mostly busy as Lead Developer and Scrum Master in a development team for designing and building the central integration hub for applications in the &quot;Digitaal Stelsel Omgevingswet&quot;, which supports the new dutch law &quot;Omgevingswet&quot; for 2019. This will land on the &quot;Standaard Platform&quot;. The main focus of the hub is routing, access-control, auditing and self-service for service providers and service consumers. As such it has high demands on availability, performance, scalability, security and privacy. Also I work closely with the Standaard Platform teams for designing new features in the platform that support the use cases for the Digitaal Stelsel Omgevingswet.</p>

<p>This generic platform is based on the Java platform and open source components. It is scalable, reliable and secure according to industry standards. A new instance of the platform, consisting of several virtual Linux servers in a cloud environment, is provisioned fully automatic from scratch and works out-of-the box. A central governance solution is included for automatic deployment through the DTAP cycle and central configuration and management of the business applications that are hosted on the platform.</p>
