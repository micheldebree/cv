# Michel de Bree

## Freelance Full Stack Developer

Full stack software developer with 20+ years of experience in complex and
dynamic IT landscapes, who thrives on working on challenging agile projects as
part of a multi-disciplinary team.

My technical experience ranges a full development stack. From, for example,
provisioning a Linux based server architecture, to developing service-oriented
JEE, to implementing a REST API driven Javascript front end. As a developer I
am at my best developing backend services and integrating them with other
components, while also being involved in the whole development stack.

My experience mainly involves customer facing internet channels that integrate
reliably and securely with back office systems, in the field of logistics,
telecommunication, banking, medical and public sector. In my daily work I
frequently communicate with business analysts as well as the IT department and
suppliers of my clients. I often have an advisory role concerning system- and
software architecture.

I prefer to work in a motivated, multi-disciplinary, self-directing team with a
clear focus on business value, in close collaboration with the various stakeholders.
I often find myself in the role of lead developer. I am also constantly looking to
improve the quality of solutions and the development process while at the same time
delivering real business value.

My broad experience and creative nature allows me to quickly asses different options
and make balanced decisions based on best practices, innovation,
fit/gap for the specific situation and the expected return on investment.
