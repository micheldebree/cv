# Michel de Bree

Full stack software developer with 20+ years of experience in complex and  dynamic IT landscapes, who thrives on working on challenging agile projects as part of a multi-disciplinary team.

My technical experience ranges a full development stack. From, for example,  provisioning a Linux based server architecture, to developing service-oriented JEE, to implementing a REST API driven AngularJS front end.

My experience mainly involves customer facing internet channels that integrate reliably and securely with back office systems, in the field of logistics, telecommunication, banking and the medical sector. In my daily work I frequently communicate with business analysts as well as the IT department and IT suppliers of my customers. I often have an advisory role concerning system- and software architecture.

I prefer to work in a motivated, multi-disciplinary, self-directing team with a clear focus on the business case and in close collaboration with the stakeholders.
